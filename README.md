This is a CI tool that analyzes the coverage rate of a pull request, ignoring the lines that were not changed in the PR.

## Motivation

The coverage rate threshold on CI tools is a common approach to encourage developers to write tests and keep improving the whole project's quality. Unfortunately, judging a pull request coverage by analyzing the coverage of the entire project is not always fair, especially on big refactor tasks, witch may naturally decrease the coverage rate.

This package tries a different approach to analyse the test coverage. We only analyse lines that have been added in the pull request. The coverage rate will be calculated by dividing the amount of uncovered new lines by the amount of new lines.

You can set thresholds to make tests fail on a CI tool. This package can also print those lines that were not covered, making it easier to identify the missing tests.

## Installing
Add this line to your package's pubspec.yaml under the `dev_dependencies` section:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  pull_request_coverage:
```

You should specify the version to avoid breaking changes


## Usage

This package uses two information to generate its report:
- A `lcov.info` file, generated by the `flutter test --coverage` command
- A diff between the current branch and the main one, generated by the `git diff` command

#### Generating the lcov.info file
There is a known issue with the `flutter test --coverage` command. It may not report untested files. There is a workaround for it, described in this [issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/27997#issuecomment-1144247839)

Run the following command to generate the `coverage/lcov.info` file:
```bash
flutter test --coverage
```

### Running pull_request_coverage
To check the PR's code, this packages needs a diff between its branch and the target one of the repository. The diff is read from the `STDIN` input.

You can feed the STDIN using bash's `|` operator, like this:
```bash
git diff repository/main | flutter pub run pull_request_coverage
```

#### Output example:

Red lines, starting with a `â¬¤` symbol, are the uncovered ones.

Example with thresholds set and not showing uncovered lines:
```bash
git diff repository/main | flutter pub run pull_request_coverage --minimum-coverage 95 --maximum-uncovered-lines 5 --hide-uncovered-lines
```

This is a CI tool that analyzes the coverage rate of a pull request, ignoring the lines that were not changed in the PR.

## Motivation

The coverage rate threshold on CI tools is a common approach to encourage developers to write tests and keep improving the whole project's quality. Unfortunately, judging a pull request coverage by analyzing the coverage of the entire project is not always fair, especially on big refactor tasks, witch may naturally decrease the coverage rate.

This package tries a different approach to analyse the test coverage. We only analyse lines that have been added in the pull request. The coverage rate will be calculated by dividing the number of uncovered new lines by the number of new lines.

You can set thresholds to make tests fail on a CI. This package can also print those lines that were not covered, making it easier to identify the missing tests.

## Installing
Add this line to your package's pubspec.yaml under the `dev_dependencies` section:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  pull_request_coverage:
```

You should specify the version to avoid breaking changes


## Usage

This package uses two information to generate its report:
- A `lcov.info` file, generated by the `flutter test --coverage` command
- A diff between the current branch and the main one, generated by the `git diff` command

#### Generating the lcov.info file
There is a known issue with the `flutter test --coverage` command. It may not report untested files. There is a workaround for it, described in this [issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/27997#issuecomment-1144247839)

Run the following command to generate the `coverage/lcov.info` file:
```bash
flutter test --coverage
```

### Running pull_request_coverage
To check the PR's code, pull_request_coverage needs a diff between its branch and the target one. The diff is read from the `STDIN` input.

You can feed the STDIN using bash's `|` operator, like this:
```bash
git diff repository/main | flutter pub run pull_request_coverage
```

#### Output example:

Uncovered lines are printed in red, starting with `â†’` symbol.

Example with thresholds set and not showing uncovered lines:
```bash
git diff repository/main | flutter pub run pull_request_coverage --minimum-coverage 95 --maximum-uncovered-lines 5 --hide-uncovered-lines
```


## Exit code

| Code | Description                                       |
|------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 0    | Tests passed.                                     |
| 1    | Tests failed (only when thresholds are set).      |
| 255  | Execution has failed and tests were not executed. |

## Parameters

### --lcov-file
- default : `coverage/lcov.info`

The path to the lcov.info file generated by the `flutter test --coverage` command.

### --exclude-suffix
- default: `.g.dart,.pb.dart,.pbenum.dart,.pbserver.dart,.pbjson.dart`

Exclude all file paths that start with those suffixes, separated by commas

### --exclude-prefix
Exclude all paths that start with those prefixes, separated by commas

### --minimum-coverage
Fail the test if the coverage rate is below this value

### --maximum-uncovered-lines
Fail the test if the the number of uncovered lines is less than this value

### --report-fully-covered-files
- default: true

The file path of each fully covered file will be printed, as a celebrating message =)

### --show-uncovered-code
- default: true

The source code of the uncovered lines will be printed, with a red font color, to make it easier to identify the missing tests.
If this parameter is set to `false`, only the file path will be shown on the log.

### --use-colorful-font
- default : true

pull_request_coverage uses a colorful font to highlight the uncovered lines. You can disable it by setting this parameter to `false`
